# JUsample
A test non-responsive website design
This is a desktop-only website design for my University
The entire page is made using HTML and CSS only. 
There's only the homepage and 6 other pages that are linked to it right now

-- What I've learned from the project --
* How to use animations using CSS
* How the relative paths work in links
* Designing scrollbars
* History of the University

-- Goals for upcoming project --
* Learn Javascript and backend to create more useful pages
* Learn to make responsive pages
