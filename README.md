# JUsample
A test non-responsive website design
This is a desktop-only website design for my University
The entire page is made using HTML and CSS only. 
There's only the homepage and 6 other pages that are linked to it right now

You can visit the prototype website at: https://f-a-i-s-a-l.github.io/JUsample/
